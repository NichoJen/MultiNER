# MultiNER
## Training
See how the models were trained in the `colab_notebooks/training`. Note that these Notebooks need to be run in Google colab to function.
## Evaluation
Evaluation is also done using the `evalutate_models` notebook in `colab_notebooks/evaluation`. Note that this notebook must also be run in Google colab.
It also requires that a zip file containing the models in the `models` folder be uploaded
